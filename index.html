				<p>Goals. Assists. Points. +/-. Games. Short handed points. Power Play points. Even Strength points. 4v4 points. 5v5 points. 3v3 points. Shootout points. Faceoffs won. Faceoffs lost. Faceoffs taken. Hits. Blocked shots. Takeaways. Giveaways. PIM. Shots taken. Shooting percentage. So many stats but not one takes into account if the player is underused. The first stat I came up with is the famous "sYn/60" stat, which predicts how many points a player would score if he was used to his best potential. This is useful to find hidden superstars; that is to say, players who would be consider superstars if only they were used on the first power play unit, like Brad Marchand was. After creating this stat, I set out to create more stats that help us understand how good each player is, and so the sYn% was born, which helps us rank goalies with other players. </p>
				<p>I hope you can find a use for my stats and most importantly, please share them with everybody you know so that I can get a job as a Statistical Analyst for an NHL team, and maybe, just maybe, a General Manager, like Kyle Dubas and John Chayka before me. Thank you and enjoy browsing my library of stats!</p>
